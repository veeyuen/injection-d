  <h1>Injected Metrics (Evolution “Current”)</h1>

  <!-- Keep marker NON-NUMERIC to avoid year-token pollution -->

  <p id="marker">INJECTION_DIFF_DEMO_V1</p>

  <h2>Baseline-aligned metrics (should bind to Analysis keys)</h2>

  <!-- These are intentionally different from baseline so diff activates -->

  <p><strong>Global EV sales (2024):</strong> 18.5 million units</p>
  <p><strong>Global EV sales (2025):</strong> 20.5 million units</p>

  <!-- Include China explicitly so it can bind to 2025_china_ev_sales__unknown -->

  <p><strong>China EV sales (2025):</strong> 13.4 million units</p>

  <!-- Match the “projected 2026” wording explicitly -->

  <p><strong>Projected global EV sales (2026):</strong> 24.6 million units</p>

  <h2>Optional extras (safe to include, won’t block diffing)</h2>

  <!-- These should bind to market share / revenue keys if present, but are not required -->

  <p><strong>EV market share (2024):</strong> 20.0%</p>
  <p><strong>EV revenue (2026):</strong> US$ 1050.0 billion</p>

  <!-- Extra synonym hints to help semantic binding -->
